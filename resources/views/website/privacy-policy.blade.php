                    <p class="">We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal
                        data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal data you
                        provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities.
                    </p>

                    <p class="">Finberg retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and
                        the feedback you have requested, or for other essential purposes, such as complying with our
                        legal obligations, enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data
                        types, actual retention periods may vary. The criteria used to determine the retention periods
                        include:
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-3"><b><i>• Is the personal data of a sensitive type?</i> </b> If so, a shortened
                        retention time would generally be appropriate, which amounts to up to five years or for the
                        duration of membership.</p>
                    <p class="pt-3"><b><i>• Is Finberg subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to
                                retain the data? </i> </b> We collect your first and last name, work email address,
                        phone number, company name and other similar contact data.</p>
